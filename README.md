POC for writing C++ modules for the Linux kernel
================================================

C++ has lots of issues which are not dealt with in the kernel.
* Problems in linking.
* Exception handling that needs to be turned off.
* Memory management functions (like new and delete) which need to be implemented.
* The kernel headers are not suitable for inclusion for a C++ compiler
since they conflict with many C++ constructs ('class' for instance and more).
* The kernel build system does not compile C++ correctly, or even at all.

* separate the "top part" - the one that is getting called by Linux, like driver
entry and exit points, interrupt functions, tasklets, whatever and handle them in a C layer.
expose APIs for all of these facilities and other low level facilities (printk, hardware access
and more) via C functions.
* write a top part that only accesses these services by well controlled C functions which do
not include the kernel headers and are C++ friendly. In the top part write a framework for
device driver writing based on OO concepts (inherit from Device and implement the relevant
methods).

* Add ability to include header files directly in C++ code.
Progress: have 'copy_headers' target in makefile
which also applies patch but headers are still hard to
work with...
This is to be developed as a patch to the linux kernel (big project - watch out!
may never happen...)
* add a framework for writing char drivers

* http://code.google.com/p/kernelcpp/
They do not have a buffer layer but instead do "extern C" before kernel headers.
Try to see if this works for a big example.
They have all kinds of other ideas about constructors for global object and so on.
